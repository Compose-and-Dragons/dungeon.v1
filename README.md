# Compose and Dragons

## VSCode Setup

The `.vscode` folder is **mandatory**. Certain settings and extensions are used to improve document and source code display and facilitate presentation.

## Launching the Docker Compose Project

At the project root, run the following command to start the Docker containers:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f mcp-dungeon mcp-gateway dungeon-end-of-level-boss
```
> Or use `build-start-dungeon.sh`

### What is being launched?

```bash
docker compose ps --services
```

- `mcp-dungeon` (project: `dungeon-crawler-mcp-server`): the custom MCP server for the dungeon game. (transport used: Streamable HTTP)
  - The server is started automatically
- `mcp-gateway`: the MCP Gateway server that allows connection to the `mcp-dungeon` MCP server and potentially other MCP servers.
  - The gateway is started automatically
- `dungeon-end-of-level-boss` (project: `dungeon-end-of-level-boss`): a **"functional"** "independent" AI agent that uses 2 technical agents (1 for chat completion, the other for RAG).
  - This is an "End-of-level Boss" NPC, named **"Shesepankh"** who will be used at the dungeon exit.
  - The agent configuration data is in the `dungeon-end-of-level-boss/data` folder
  - The agent is started automatically: on first startup, the agent will build the vector store in a JSON file from the configuration data. This may take a moment. It will then be instantaneous on subsequent startups.
- `dungeon-master` (project: `dungeon-master`): it is composed of **multiple** **"functional"** AI agents:
  - **"Zephyr"**: can be considered the "dungeon master" who manages the game state and interacts with the player.
    - The container is started but the `dungeon-master` program is **not** launched automatically.
    - It will detect player commands and call other **"functional"** agents if necessary.
    - It will use MCP Tools from the `mcp-dungeon` MCP server to respond to player actions.
    - It uses 1 technical agent (1 for chat completion & tool call detection).
  - The other **"functional"** agents (NPCs) are invoked by "Zephyr" **on demand** from the player.
    - **"Galdor"**: an NPC Merchant
    - **"Elara"**: an NPC Sorceress
    - **"Thrain"**: an NPC Guardian
    - **"Liora"**: an NPC Healer
    - Each of them uses 2 technical agents (1 for chat completion, the other for RAG).
    - ‚úãüëª *there is also a "Ghost agent" which is a fake AI agent for testing purposes - no utility for gameplay*.

### Launching the "Zephyr" agent (the Dungeon Master with user interface)

To launch the user interface, execute the following command in a new terminal:
```bash
docker attach $(docker compose ps -q dungeon-master)
```
On first startup, the 4 NPC agents will each build a vector store in a JSON file from configuration data (present in the `dungeon-master/data` folder). This may take a moment. It will then be instantaneous on subsequent startups.

## Game Operation Principle

- The dungeon is extremely simple: a 4x4 square. (configurable in the `compose.yml` file)
- The 4 NPCs as well as the end-level Boss are placed in advance in specific rooms.
  - This position configuration is done in the `compose.yml` file
- We use the "Dungeon Crawler" principle (dungeon exploration) with dynamically generated rooms:
  - Once a room is generated, it is stored in the `mcp-dungeon` MCP server (tool: `store_room`) and will no longer be modified (the player can return to the room).
  - When generating a room, we can also generate:
    - objects (potions, gold coins) which are stored in the `mcp-dungeon` MCP server.
    - enemies (monsters) which are also stored in the `mcp-dungeon` MCP server.
    - The player can interact with objects and enemies (combat, collect objects, etc.)
- The player can move in 4 directions (north, south, east, west) and interact with NPCs.
- The goal of the game is to find and defeat the end-level Boss (**Shesepankh**) who is located in a specific room.
- **[üöß not yet implemented (1)]** The player will collect information from NPCs that will be useful during their discussion with **Shesepankh**. The player will therefore need to meet all NPCs and ask them the right questions.
- **[üöß not yet implemented (2)]** The player will need to give the collected information to **Shesepankh** for her to agree to let them exit.

> - (1): this should be possible with prompts only.
> - (2): this should be possible with prompts + MCP tool(s).

## Game Flow

1. Launch the Docker Compose project (see above)
2. ‚è≥ Wait 
3. Launch the "Zephyr" agent (the Dungeon Master with user interface) (see above)
4. The game begins, the player is in the starting room (0,0)

### At game launch (Dungeon Master)

```
docker attach $(docker compose ps -q dungeon-master)
/app # ./dungeon-master
```

**If everything goes well**, you should see a display similar to this:

#### `get_current_room_info`

**You are at the dungeon entrance, you can start by looking around:**
```raw

#### `move_by_direction`

**You can now move around the dungeon. For example, to go north:**
```raw
‚îÉ ü§ñ (/bye to exit) [Zephyr]>                                                                                                  
‚îÉ I want to move to the north 
```
> Theoretically I can even say "I want to go to the north, then to the east, then to the north again" and Zephyr should understand and make the 3 movements. (üêõ fix: Zephyr detects the 3 movements well, performs them but displays the room information of the arrival of the 1st movement. [TODO: to fix - not priority])

**Zephyr's response:**

---[DM RESPONSE]----------------------------------
You have moved to the **Rune Altar** room. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, with cobwebs and dust covering the stone walls. A strong musty smell is in the air. In the center of the room is a pedestal with ancient runes and a glowing amulet. There is also a **magic potion** here that can restore **14 health points**!

Would you like to **collect the magic potion** or **investigate the pedestal and amulet**?
--------------------------------------------------
```

You can see that it's possible to collect the magic potion present in the room.

#### `collect_magic_potion`

**To collect the magic potion, just ask for it:**
```raw
‚îÉ ü§ñ (/bye to exit) [Zephyr]>
‚îÉ I want to collect the magic potion
```

**Zephyr's response:**
```raw

#### `get_player_info`

**To check your character's status, you can ask for their information:**

**Etc. ...**

### Talking to an NPC

**[üöß for now you can invoke a character from anywhere]** TODO: verify that the NPC is in the current room before being able to talk to them.

To talk to an NPC, just address them by name. For example, to talk to the merchant "Galdor":
```raw
‚îÉ ü§ñ (/bye to exit) [Zephyr]>
‚îÉ I want to speak to Galdor
```

**Zephyr's response:**
```raw
< Zephyr speaking...>
‚†∏ Tools detection.....üü¢ speak_to_somebody with arguments: {"name":"Galdor"}
Do you want to execute this function? (y)es (n)o (a)bort (y/n/a) [y]:     
```

**Then:**
```raw
---[MCP RESPONSE]---------------------------------
{"result": "üòÉ You speak to {"name":"Galdor"}. They greet you warmly and are eager to assist you on your quest."}
--------------------------------------------------
---[DM RESPONSE]----------------------------------
Galdor is a friendly and helpful character in the dungeon. He has offered to assist you on your quest. What would you like to do next?
--------------------------------------------------

‚îÉ üôÇ (/bye to exit /dm to go back to the DM) [Galdor]>                                                                                                  
‚îÉ Type your command here...                                                                                                                             
‚îÉ                                                                                                                                                       
‚îÉ                                                   
```

Now you can converse with "Galdor". To return to "Zephyr", just type the `/dm` command.

```raw
‚îÉ üôÇ (/bye to exit /dm to go back to the DM) [Galdor]>                                                                                                  
‚îÉ Hello, I'm Bob, tell me something about your family   
```

**Galdor's response:**

```raw

Hello Bob, thank you for asking. Galdor is descended from a family of craftsmen, including his father a blacksmith and mother a jeweler. His family has a long history of trade and craftsmanship, passed down through generations. His brother, who runs the family forge in Khaz Ankor, is a skilled artisan himself.
