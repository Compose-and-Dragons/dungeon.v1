## What is MCP and Why Does It Matter?

- **Communication protocol** between generative AI applications (and LLMs) and tool servers
- **MCP servers** provide a list of <span class="dodgerblue">**tools**</span> (and <span class="dodgerblue">**resources**</span>), execute them on demand from the AI application, and return results
- **Delegation to dedicated applications**: MCP servers handle tool execution
- **Enhanced AI capabilities**: super power for LLMs
