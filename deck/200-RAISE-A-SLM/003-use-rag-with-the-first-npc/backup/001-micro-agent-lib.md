# Micro Agent Library

> As we progressed in developing the game POC, we ended up with a set of tools that eventually became a library: **ÂµAgent**. It's simply a kind of wrapper on top of OpenAI's Golang SDK. So it's very easy to unravel the code to return to a more 'vanilla' version that's closer to the original SDK.
